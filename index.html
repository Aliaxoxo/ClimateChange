<h2 style="color:#FFFF00">What Is Climate Change?</h2>
<iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" width="250" height="150"></iframe>	
<p>Climate change is generally defined as a significant variation of average weather conditions—say, conditions becoming warmer, wetter, or drier—over several decades or more. It’s the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability.</p>
<p>Record floods. Raging storms. Deadly heat. Climate change manifests itself in many ways and is experienced by every living being, although not equally. Throughout the world, the economically disadvantaged people of color are the most likely to suffer from its worst impacts. Here are the basics on what causes climate change, how it’s affecting the planet and its people, and what we can do about it.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:#00FF00">The Causes of Climate Change:</h2>
<p>When energy from the sun is reflected off the earth and back into space (mostly by clouds and ice), or when the earth’s atmosphere releases energy, the planet cools. When the earth absorbs the sun’s energy, or when atmospheric gases prevent heat released by the earth from radiating into space (the greenhouse effect), the planet warms. A variety of factors, both natural and human, can influence the earth’s climate system.</p>
